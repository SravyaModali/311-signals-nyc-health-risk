# 311 Signals: Predicting Health & Cost Risks in NYC Neighborhoods

## 📍 Problem Statement
New York City has made major strides in collecting civic and health-related data, but a real-time, unified system that connects 311 complaints with public health outcomes and financial impact still does not exist. Data systems like EpiQuery, HHS-Connect, and NYC Open Data remain fragmented, limiting early detection of health risks and cost inefficiencies.

311 service requests—covering issues like rodents, air quality, and housing conditions—contain valuable signals that often precede public health challenges. Yet this data is rarely used to inform timely interventions. As a result, many issues escalate into crises, especially in underserved neighborhoods, increasing both human and economic costs.

This project aims to bridge that gap by analyzing 311 trends to predict neighborhood-level health and cost risks, empowering smarter, data-driven decisions by city planners and health departments.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
- Analyze patterns in 311 complaints across NYC neighborhoods over time
- Identify correlations between complaint types and public health outcomes
- Predict neighborhood-level health and cost risks using complaint data
- Build an interactive dashboard to visualize high-risk areas and support early intervention

## 🌍 Real-World Relevance
This project helps city departments and public health agencies leverage 311 complaint data as an early warning system for health and cost-related risks. By identifying patterns and predicting where issues are likely to escalate, the model supports timely, data-driven interventions that can prevent avoidable health crises and reduce public spending. It also promotes greater transparency and ensures resources are allocated more equitably—especially in underserved neighborhoods that often face delayed responses.D
